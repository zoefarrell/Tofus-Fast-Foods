### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
-render anime components onto page
-create a button to create the anime component
-allow users to edit that component
-allow user to post comment about their favorite anime and add info

#### PostMVP  
-add second to gather more info about certain anime
-add more user interface
- Add More styling for now

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
I think initially I would have no problems getting my react componets setup. I am also very excited for the styling because i believe i have improved with that a lot.
### Weaknesses:
Im still not very comfortable with react API structure and feel like that will take me time to put things together.

### Opportunities:
I have an opportunity to improve the above weaknesses. I also have an opportunity to add images to my work and a second API.
### Threats:
Im afraid things will take me longer than they should becaue i feel as though i doubt myself when it comes to my time managment which will make things take longer for me.
