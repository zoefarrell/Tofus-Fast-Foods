### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*React

 *Linting
Indent properly.
Utilize high-quality, semantic variable names.
Follow camelCase, kebab-case and PascalCase conventions.
Remove unnecessary boilerplate React files and code.
Remove all console.log()s and commented out code (functional notes and comments are acceptable).
*Deployment
Deployed via Netlify.
#### PostMVP  

- Add More styling for now
## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all parts of your app.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Planning | H | 3hrs|  | 3.5hrs |
| Setting up airtabel | H | 3hrs| | 2.5hrs |
| Routing Setup| H | 6hrs|  | 5hrs |
| Axios Requests| H | 6hrs|  | 5hrs |
| Responsiveness| H | 6hrs|  | 5hrs |
| Form Setup| H | 6hrs|  | 5hrs |
| Form Handling| H | 6hrs| | 5hrs |
| Posts Rendering| H | 6hrs|| 5hrs |
| Page setups| H | 6hrs| | 5hrs |
| React Strcture| H | 6hrs| | 5hrs |
| Total| H | | | 44hrs |


## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
I think initially I would have no problems getting my react componets setup. I am also very excited for the styling because i believe i have improved with that a lot.
### Weaknesses:
Im still not very comfortable with react API structure and feel like that will take me time to put things together.

### Opportunities:
I have an opportunity to improve the above weaknesses. I also have an opportunity to add images to my work and a second API.
### Threats:
Im afraid things will take me longer than they should becaue i feel as though i doubt myself when it comes to my time managment which will make things take longer for me.
