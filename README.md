### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MVP and PostMVP.  Carefully decide what is placed into your MVP, as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 
*React
Be a working, interactive React app, built using create react app.
Utilize React Router, installed via NPM.
Have at least 6 separate, rendered components.
Implement an organized and understandable React file structure.
Utilize functional and/or class React components appropriately.
Use Axios to consume data from Airtable, and GET/render that data in your components.
Use Axios to POST/create new data on Airtable.
Use only React for DOM Manipulation.
Styling
Be styled, use any combination of CSS, Styled Components, CSS-in-JS, or a component library to style your React project.
Use flexbox (display: flex) or CSS Grid (N/A if using a component library that handles this).
Implement responsive design on 2 screen sizes, using a media query (desktop and mobile and N/A if using a component library that handles this).
 *Linting
Indent properly.
Utilize high-quality, semantic variable names.
Follow camelCase, kebab-case and PascalCase conventions.
Remove unnecessary boilerplate React files and code.
Remove all console.log()s and commented out code (functional notes and comments are acceptable).
*Deployment
Deployed via Netlify.
#### PostMVP  

- Add More styling for now
## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all parts of your app.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.
